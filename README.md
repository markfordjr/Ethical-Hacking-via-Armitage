# Ethical-Hacking-via-Armitage

I used a tool called Armitage to perform the three phases of penetration testing.

I use two virtual machines (VMs), Kali (Kali Linux) and Windows 10, managed by Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager. Virutal machines work like real computers, but they are not physical computers and run on a real physical computer. For example, in my setup, a computer running the Kubuntu Linux actually hosts and runs Kali and Windows VMs.
Kali will be the attacking computer and Windows will be the target.
Armitage is launched from Kali and exploits a vulnerability in a chat server called vchat.exe.
